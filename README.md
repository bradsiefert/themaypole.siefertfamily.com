# The Maypole Project Instructions
Hello! This is the simple site I built to house my family's occasionally sent update newsletter. I originally built it using Gridsome, but migrated it to Nuxt 3.

It uses:
- Nuxt 3
- Content v2
- Mailchimp
- Markdown files

To learn more about Nuxt 3 and Content v2 check out: [Content documentation](https://content-v2.nuxtjs.org/) to learn more.
